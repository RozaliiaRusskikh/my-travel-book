# My Travel Book
Link: https://my-travel-memory-book.netlify.app

My Travel Book is a full-stack CRUD web application that contains my favorite travel memories and notes which I can share with my family and friends. Also, it has quick facts about any country around the world.

## Problem/ Solution

I am a travel lover. Different countries, meeting new people, and having adventures are my passion. I have a lot of photos and memories that are related to places where I have been. So, I would like to keep them in one place like in a memory book, tell my travel stories, and turn my past vacations into a productive endeavor by creating a travel website.
Also, I want to track my trips by pinning my locations on a map which can help me make my travel diary and watch it evolve each time I step out of the house.
